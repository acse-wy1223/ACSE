# Introduction
Welcome to XIIA: Xavier Initialisation Image Application! 

# How To Use
To utilize this tool effectively, users can follow the steps outlined below to navigate through the interfaces for 2D and 3D image processing.

## General Steps
1. **Start the Program**: Run the executable to start the program. This brings up the main menu.
2. **Choose between 2D and 3D**: At the main menu, select whether you wish to work with 2D or 3D images. Input `1` for 2D and `2` for 3D processing. To exit the program, enter `0`.

## For 2D Image Processing
1. **Enter the Path of the Input Image**: After selecting 2D processing, you'll be prompted to enter the path to your image file.
2. **Choose a Filter**: You will see a list of available filters (e.g., Grayscale, Brightness, Histogram Equalisation, etc.). Enter the number corresponding to the filter you wish to apply.
3. **Configure the Filter (if required)**: Some filters might require additional input, such as brightness value or kernel size. Follow the prompts to input these values.
4. **Save Processed Image**: After applying a filter, you'll be prompted to enter a path to save the processed image.
5. **Continue or Exit**: Decide if you want to apply another filter to the same image or finish processing. To add another filter, input `y` when asked; to finish, input `n`.

## For 3D Image Processing
1. **Enter the Path of the Input Volume**: After selecting 3D processing, you'll first be prompted to enter the path to your 3D volume data.
2. **Choose a Filter or Operation**: You will see a menu for selecting a 3D filter (e.g., Gaussian Filter, Median Filter) or operation (e.g., Projection, Slice). Select the desired option by entering its corresponding number.
3. **Configure the Filter or Operation (if required)**: Depending on your choice, you might need to specify additional parameters, such as filter size or sigma for Gaussian filtering, or select slices for projection.
4. **Save Processed Volume or Slices**: After applying a filter or operation, you'll be prompted to enter a path to save the output.
5. **Continue, Back, or Exit**: After each operation, you can choose to apply another filter or operation, go back to the previous menu, or exit the program. Select the appropriate option as per your needs.

## Exiting the Program
- **Exit at Any Time**: You can exit the program at any time by selecting the `Exit` or `Back` option available in the menus, eventually leading you back to the main menu where you can exit the program by entering `0`.
