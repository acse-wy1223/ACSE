This template is highly based in the datafusion template [here](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md).

ChatGPT was used to simplify the above datafusion template as shown in the chat discussion [here](https://chat.openai.com/share/009b0948-0ca7-45bb-8c2d-1f8dd1b92902).

Then I made minor changes to the ChatGPT response.
